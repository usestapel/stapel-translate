"""Drift gate for the `surface` section of ``docs/capabilities.json``.

The IsNotAnonymousUser incident is why this section exists at all: a product
bolted on its own DRF permission gate, unaware the framework already shipped
one, because the module's contract document could describe what you may
switch on (``axes``) and what you may replace (``extension_points``) and had
no way at all to name a symbol you are supposed to CALL
(discoverability-design.md §1.2).

``surface`` names them, with one curated line each saying when to reach for
them. The entry set is derived by AST from the roots in
``docs/capabilities.meta.json`` — a new public class/function in a declared
root shows up here by itself and fails emission until somebody explains it.

Honest boundary: the REST of this module's ``capabilities.json`` is still
hand-written (no gate registry, no ``docs/schema.json``), so only
``module``/``version``/``surface`` are gated below.
